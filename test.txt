INTRODUCTION
Structure of branched epithelial tubes
Epithelial tubes are essential functional components of tubular organs of
metazoans, such as lung, kidney, alimentary canal and vascular system. These
tubular organs carry out the vital functions of transporting gases, cells, hormones,
enzymes and nutrients and eliminate waste from the body to maintain normal
metabolism and to sustain life. Epithelial tubes arise in various shapes and sizes
and the ability to carry out their function relies largely on the distinct length and
diameter of each tube. There are several defects and pathologies associated with
developmental or acquired morphological instabilities of biological tubes, such as
polycystic kidney disease (Deane and Ricardo 2007), atherosclerosis, ischemia
and fibrocystic breast disease. Due to the clinical relevance of epithelial tube size
regulation, equally entrancing questions have been put forth recently by
researchers worldwide, including those that address the cellular and molecular
mechanisms regulating biological tube dimensions.
In both vertebrates and invertebrates, epithelial tubes can be highly
elaborate and complex or simple unbranched cylindrical structures depending on
the specific organ function. However, arrangement of epithelial cells in these tubes
are relatively simple with only one layer of cells lining the lumen to facilitate its
functions such as absorption and secretion. In vertebrates, epithelial tubes can be
derived from one of the three primary germ layers; ectoderm, endoderm or 3
mesoderm. During the formation of epithelial tubes, initially the cells arrange side
by side and connect with each other through intercellular junctions to form an
epithelial sheath. The cells in the epithelial sheath then migrate and rearrange
themselves in a coordinated manner to form the lumen. There is a remarkable
diversity in the mechanisms of lumen formation among the epithelial tubes
including; wrapping, budding, hollowing and cavitation. Wrapping and budding
are seen in polarized epithelia whereas, hollowing and cavitation are features of
unpolarized epithelia. During budding and wrapping (Lubarsky and Krasnow
2003) the primordium of epithelial tube invade to form a cup like structure. This
process is mostly driven by the apical membrane constriction (Sawyer et al. 2010).
In unpolarized epithelial sheath, lumen arise intracellularly as small cytoplasmic
vesicles which fuse to form larger vesicles. Later, the vesicles fuse with the apical
plasma membrane to connect with the lumina of the adjacent cells within the tube.
This kind of lumen formation is called hollowing. Budding and hollowing are
mechanistically similar in that both require vesicle fusion, suggesting a similar
mechanism of lumen formation. Cavitation of unpolarized cells begin with the cell
polarization at the periphery followed by apoptosis of the cells at the center to
form the lumen. Followed by the establishment of lumen, epithelial tubes elongate
by cell shape changes, cell rearrangements, cell recruitment or by cell division. In
most cases, epithelial cells are surrounded by supporting cells (mesenchyme) and
luminal extracellular matrix (ECM) which provide structural rigidity and support. 4
Epithelial tubes exhibits certain key features, including close cell–cell
contact and adhesion, apico-basal polarity, specialized intercellular junctions
connecting neighboring cells and a basally located basement membrane. Each of
these features can be independently modulated so as to attain proper tube
dimensions. Despite the similarities of vertebrate and invertebrate epithelial tissue,
there are some striking differences. For example, the cell junctions of invertebrate
epithelial tissue are composed of sub apical complex, adherens junction (AJ) and
septate junction (SJ) (Figure 1B), whereas vertebrate cell junctions comprise tight
junction (TJ), AJ and desmosomes (Figure 1A). TJ in vertebrate and SJ in
invertebrates share a common para cellular barrier function and are composed of
claudins (Wu et al. 2004a). However the location on the cell junction with respect
to AJ differs in that TJ is apical and the SJ is basal to the adherens junction (Knust
and Bossinger 2002).
Development of tubular epithelia comprise of two independent process;
early pattering and tube maturation. Early patterning is the process by which
epithelial tubes acquire branch specificity. This process is under strict control of
signaling pathways. Once the branch identity is specified tubes reach their final
functional dimensions through the process of maturation. Even though the early
patterning of tubular networks have been studied elaborately, (Andrew and Ewald
2010; Horowitz and Simons 2008; Lu and Werb 2008) mechanisms by which
tubes acquire their mature sizes remain largely unknown. Both invertebrate and
vertebrate model systems and cell lines such as Madin-Darby canine kidney 5

and SJ in invertebrates share a common para cellular barrier function. However,

junction.
(MDCK) cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)
which form tubes when cultured with appropriate signals have been used to study
the tubular organ development (Brouns et al. 2000; O’Brien & Mostov 2002).
Even though vertebrate systems can be used to study tube morphogenesis, it is
highly challenging to address such mechanisms in vertebrates due to their complex

architecture. One of the tractable and most studied model system for tube size
regulation is Drosophila melanogaster trachea. Over the past few years, the use of
Drosophila in developmental studies have increased immensely. This is mainly
because of the availability of established methods for handling and manipulating
flies and the immense understanding of fly biology.

Drosophila as a model organism
Drosophila has been used as a model system in genetic studies since the
time of Thomas Hunt Morgan. One of the most important characteristics of a
model organism to be used in genetic studies is its short life cycle. Drosophila has
a very short life cycle which is temperature dependent. The optimum temperature
for growth is 25ᵒC in which the fly takes about 10 days to complete life cycle
whereas, at 18ᵒC the duration of life cycle almost doubles. This short life cycle
allows geneticist to set up large scale crosses followed through several generations
in months’ time. Another advantage of this organism is its simple and inexpensive
diet. Moreover completion of Drosophila genome sequencing in 2001
revolutionized use of flies in genetic and developmental studies. Fly genome is
165 million base pairs long, hosting approximately 14,000 genes. Even though
humans have considerably higher number of genes than flies, the number of gene
families are comparable. Increase in number of genes in humans can be attributed
to the gene duplication events occurred during the course of evolution.
Nevertheless, most of the genes as well as developmental mechanisms are well 7
conserved between Drosophila and humans such that most of the newly
discovered genes including those responsible for various diseases can often be
matched against the fruit fly counterparts. To study the functionality of a gene,
mutations can be induced easily either by exposing flies to radiation or mutagenic
chemicals such as EMS or through transposon based gene excision. In addition,
advanced DNA manipulation techniques such as CRISPER technology also have
been used successfully in flies. This way mutant flies are already available for a
large number of genes. Drosophila has a small genome with only three pairs of
autosomes in addition to X and Y chromosomes. X chromosome is often
considered as the first chromosome. Second and third chromosomes are the largest
and Y and fourth chromosomes are smaller with the least genetic information.
Another advantage of flies is the lack of genetic recombination in males. There are
also various genetic markers and tools that has been developed in flies including
balancer chromosomes. Balancer chromosomes contain multiple inversions which
prevent the recombination with the homologous chromosomes. In addition, the
balancer chromosome contains one or more dominant or recessive markers which
are often lethal when homozygous. The advantage of balancer chromosome in fly
genetics is that mutations created on a chromosome will be preserved in
subsequent generations if the homologous chromosome is a balancer that prevents
genetic recombination. At the same time genetic markers on these balancers can
be used to track down segregation of chromosomes and mutations during various
genetic crosses by following the phenotype. Balancer chromosomes are available 8
for each one of the corresponding fly chromosome. All the above mentioned
characteristics make Drosophila one of the best model organism to study basic
principles of patterning, organ development, signaling pathways, behavioral
studies and as a disease model. Furthermore, Drosophila embryonic trachea is
used widely as an excellent in vivo model to study the epithelial morphogenesis
and tube size defects. It is a tractable model system with a simple structure,
monolayer of epithelial cells and highly specified tube dimensions. The
mechanisms of tube-size regulation revealed by the Drosophila trachea will help
us understand the normal development of human tubular organs and thus the
mechanism of human diseases associated with tube-size defects.
Development of the Drosophila Trachea
Trachea serves the role of both pulmonary and vascular system in
Drosophila melanogaster. Embryonic trachea develops from series of segmentally
repeated ectodermal clusters between embryonic stages 11 and 17. Initially,
JAK/STAT signaling induces the tracheal formation by activating the expression
of two of the earliest tracheal genes, trachealess (trh) and ventral veinless (vvl)
(Chung, Chavez, and Andrew 2011; J. Li et al. 2003; Sotillos et al. 2010). Trh and
Vvl are transcription factors which regulate downstream target genes required for
tracheal development (Chung et al. 2011). At embryonic stage 11, the tracheal
precursor cells arrange themselves in 10 groups of approximately 80 cells each, on
either side of the embryo from second thoracic to eighth abdominal segment 9
(Kerman & Andrew 2006). Subsequently, the precursor to each hemi-segment of
the tracheal network called tracheal placodes are formed by elongation of tracheal
precursor cells along the apico basal axis. Further, activation of EGF signaling in
tracheal precursor cells lead to the invagination of two to three cells of tracheal
placodes to form tracheal sac. This invagination happens through an apical
constriction mechanism (Brodu and Casanova 2006; M Llimargas and Casanova
1999) in which the ventral cells invaginate ahead of the dorsal cells (Samakovlis et
al. 1996). From this point onwards tracheal cells stop dividing and further
elaboration of tracheal system is attained through coordinated cell rearrangements,
cell shape changes and cell migration (Wilk & Shilo 1996). The specification of
tracheal precursors to form specific branch types depends on various signaling
pathways such as, wingless (Wg) signaling, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)
(DPP in Drosophila trachea) signaling, and possibly epidermal growth factor
(EGF) signaling (de Celis & Casanova 1995; Isaac and Andrew 1996; Wilk &
Shilo 1996). After invagination, subset of cells in the tracheal sac, through the
process of budding migrate from each other in a stereotypical direction to form six
primary branches. Migration of specific tracheal branches along distinct direction
requires the combination of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling and branch
specific signaling (Klämbt & Shilo 1992; Reichman-Fried et al. 1994; Sutherland
& Krasnow 1996). The six primary branches include the anterior and posterior
dorsal trunks (DTa and DTp), anterior and posterior lateral trunks (LTa and LTp),
ganglionic branch (GB) and visceral branch (VB).The cells that do not contribute 10
to the primary branches form the transverse connective (TC). Specifically, cells in
the dorsal and ventral region of the tracheal sac, which are exposed to the DPP
signals (in red), migrate toward FGF signal from surrounding tissues either
dorsally to form the DB or ventrally to form both the LT and GB (Affolter et al.
1994; Chihara and Hayashi 2000; M Llimargas 2000; Vincent et al. 1997). In the
central region of the tracheal sac, there are three groups of cells. One group
exposed to Wg signaling (in yellow) migrate toward FGF signal to form the DT
(Chihara and Hayashi 2000; M Llimargas 2000), second group (in blue) exposed
to integrin signaling but not Wg signaling migrate internally to form VB; the third
group (in white) remain at the site of invagination to become TC (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Role of signaling pathways in branch specification of trachea. (A) Cells
in the central region of each tracheal placodes exposed to Wg signaling migrate to
form DT (yellow); cells remain at the site of invagination form TC (white); those
which receive TGF-β (DPP) signal (red) at the dorsal and ventral sides form DB,
LT, and GB branches. Cells that do not receive Wg signal (yellow) but receive
integrin signal migrate internally to form VB (blue). (B) Corresponding tracheal
segments in mature trachea is shown using similar colors. (C) The migration of
tracheal cells towards surrounding mesenchyme is directed by FGF signaling and
branch specific signaling. Thus different groups of cells receive specific signals
and migrate to form stereotyped branches of tracheal network. 11
At stage 12 of embryogenesis, most of the tracheal branches begin to form
and maintain a tubular structure while they continue to extend (Samakovlis et al.
1996) No new branches develop after stage 12, but the existing branches continue
to grow towards their specific targets. At stage 14, primary branches give rise to
around 25 unicellular secondary branches under the regulation of fibroblast growth
factor (FGF) signaling (Samakovlis et al. 1996; Sutherland & Krasnow 1996).
Most of the secondary branches spread cytoplasmic extensions which are
otherwise called tertiary branches.
Types of tubes in trachea
Trachea is a branched tubular epithelial network with apical surfaces of the
cells facing the lumen and the basal surfaces facing the surrounding tissues or
basal lamina. A mature trachea consists of four types of tubes (Samakovlis et al.
1996) (Fig 2). Type I tubes are multicellular and includes the main trunk of the
trachea, the dorsal trunk (DT) and majority of the transverse connective (TC).
Transverse connective acts as a stalk connecting the tracheal branches within each
metamere. In these tubes several cells are connected by intercellular junctions and
the apical membrane of the cells surround an extracellular central lumen. The
Type II tubes are unicellular and includes; lateral trunk (LT), ganglionic branch
(GB), dorsal branch (DB), and visceral branch (VB). These tubes are formed of 12
linear arrangement of single cells whose apical surfaces fold and connect with
itself through auto cellular junction to enclose an extracellular lumen. In this case,
the neighboring cells are connected through intercellular junctions. The main
function of Type I and Type II tubes are to transport gases. Type III tubes are
intracellular and connects Type I or Type II tubes of the adjacent or contralateral
tracheal metamere. Such tubes are formed by arranging two donut shaped cells, in
a linear head-to-tail configuration, and their apical surfaces span the inner wall of
the donut, resulting in seamless tubes without intracellular junctions (ex: fusion
cells). Type IV tubes are highly branched intracellular cytoplasmic extensions
protruding from the terminal cells at the tips of unicellular tubes. In such tubes
intracellular lumen arises by growth of the apical membrane inwards the cell
(Gervais and Casanova 2010). Type IV tubes contact target tissue directly for gas
exchange and this type of tubes include lateral ganglionic (LG) branches.
Overview of tracheal tube maturation
Trachea attains its final functional dimensions through the process of tube
maturation. This occurs during defined time interval between embryonic stages 13
and 16 (Tsarouhas et al. 2007). Tube maturation includes, highly coordinated
events of growth in both length and diameter through cell shape changes mainly at
the apical surface of tracheal cells. However, during tube maturation, cell number
remains unchanged (Beitel and Krasnow 2000). Key cellular processes involved in
tube maturation include; apical secretion, endocytic recycling, cytoskeletal 13
changes and junctional rearrangements (Luschnig and Uv 2014). The changes in
cell shape is initiated through, apical secretion pulses that deposit apical
membrane components and extra cellular matrix (luminal matrix). Massive
deposition of membrane and matrix components through apical secretion at early
stages of embryogenesis is likely the driving force for tube diametric expansion
and luminal matrix assembly. On the contrary, tube elongation is a continuous
process and happens throughout embryogenesis (Zuo et al. 2013;Beitel and
Krasnow 2000). Tube elongation is initiated by, Src42A, a tyrosine-protein kinase
which mediates cell shape changes by promoting AJ remodeling through DEcadherin
recycling (Förster and Luschnig 2012). At the same time, Src42A also
promotes axially oriented expansion of apical surfaces by interacting with dDaam.
dDaam is a Diaphanous-related formin that has a role in cytoskeletal
rearrangement (Nelson et al. 2012). Therefore, Src42A mediated AJ remodeling
and cytoskeleton rearrangement likely stimulates the initiation of tube elongation.
However, the specifics of AJ remodeling and cytoskeleton rearrangement is still
largely unknown. Consistent with the role of Src42A in Drosophila, vertebrate Src
interacts with Daam, the vertebrate homolog of dDaam (Aspenström and
Johansson 2006) and phosphorylates several proteins associated with cytoskeleton
and AJ (Thomas and Brugge 1997). Therefore tube elongation is initiated by
Src42A mediated AJ remodeling and cytoskeleton rearrangement and afterwards
tube elongation is a continuous process maintained by cell polarity and the luminal
matrix to ensure proper length. 14
Stability of biological tubes are determined by three important factors; the
ECM elasticity, apical membrane growth, and interaction between ECM and
apical membrane (Dong and Hayashi 2014). As mentioned earlier, the initial
deposition of apical membrane components is likely the driving force to begin the
diametric expansion. Conversely, luminal matrix components play to regulate both
tube diameter and length (Araújo et al. 2005; Devine et al. 2005; Luschnig et al.
2006; Moussian et al. 2006; Petkau et al. 2012; Tiklová and Samakovlis 2013b).
However, the interaction between apical membrane and ECM determines the final
morphology of biological tubes (Dong, Hannezo, and Hayashi 2014). The
organization of sub apical βH-Spectrin, which crosslinks the apical cytoskeleton
and membrane, is disrupted in the absence of chitin, one of the luminal
components (Tonning et al. 2005). This evidence suggests that signals originating
from the luminal matrix are likely sensed by epithelial cells to coordinate
cytoskeletal organization, to regulate tube size in both diameter and length.
Similar role of luminal matrix in lumen formation is shown in zebrafish (Bagnat et
al. 2007). In addition to apical membrane and luminal matrix components, apicalbasal
and planar cell polarity along with endocytic recycling pathways play an
important role in maintaining proper tube dimensions throughout embryogenesis.
At mid stage 17, once trachea attains its proper dimensions, the tracheal
epithelium activates a pulse of endocytic activity to internalize the secreted solid
matrix and liquid from the lumen. Subsequently, the luminal matrix is cleared
from the lumen at late stage 17, and the entire trachea is filled with air (Figure 3) 15
Figure 3. Schematic representation of tracheal maturation. (A) The initially
narrow trachea needs to expand to attain functional tube dimensions. (B) The
apical membrane pulse deposits luminal matrix and membrane components
(shown in solid red lumen) which facilitate the tube diametric expansion. (C)
Secretion of chitin deacetylases is important to maintain the fibrillar structure (red
lines) of chitin and to restrict tube elongation. (D) Once tube attains functional
dimensions, the luminal matrix components are absorbed back by the tracheal cells
(clear trachea) and (E) air starts filling the lumen.
(Swanson and Beitel 2006; Tsarouhas et al. 2007). Thus trachea becomes
functional before the hatching of embryos to form larvae.
A) Apical secretion
Apical delivery of membrane and luminal components have vital roles in
tube size regulation. During apical secretion, the membrane and luminal
components pass through a series of membrane-enclosed organelles, including
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi complex (Golgi), and various secretory
vesicles before getting delivered to the apical membrane or secreted into the
lumen. Initially, the nascent polypeptides of the membrane and luminal proteins
are synthesized on ribosomes and transported into the ER. The signal peptide (SP) 16
or signal sequence (SS) present on the polypeptides acts as a specific recognition
sequence and a critical component for targeted ER delivery (Cross et al. 2009;
Marrichi et al. 2008; Walter and Blobel 1981). While reaching the ER lumen, SS
is cleaved and protein undergo post-translational modifications and chaperon
aided folding (Ellgaard and Helenius 2003; Helenius and Aebi 2004; Yeaman et
al. 1997). Further transport of proteins across the cytoplasm is mediated by
vesicular intermediates. During vesicular trafficking vesicles bud from one
compartment and fuse with the target compartment (Mellman and Nelson
2008). There are mainly three classes of protein complexes that form these
vesicular intermediates: COPII coated vesicles (coatomer protein complex-II)
which bud from ER is crucial for ER–Golgi trafficking (Bonifacino and Glick
2004; Lee et al. 2004); COPI complexes (coatomer protein complex-I) that bud
from Golgi are crucial for Golgi-ER and intra-Golgi transport (Bonifacino and
Glick 2004; Jayaram et al. 2008; Rabouille and Klumperman 2005); third type is
the adaptor protein (AP)-clathrin complex (the AP-clathrin complex) which is
crucial for transport between the Golgi, plasma membrane and endosomes
(Schmid 1997; Traub and Kornfeld 1997). Trafficking of vesicles in the cytoplasm
occurs along actin cytoskeleton. Selective docking and targeted delivery of the
vesicles to specific membrane compartments of the cell is regulated by organelle
and tissue specific Rab GTPases, vesicle-tethering complexes and SNAREs
(Bonifacino and Glick 2004; Grosshans and Novick 2006; Hehnly and Stamnes
2007; Mellman and Nelson 2008; Rothman 1994). Consistent with these findings, 17
in Drosophila trachea, mutants disrupting the coat assembly, vesicle budding
(Förster and Luschnig 2010; Norum et al. 2010; Tsarouhas et al. 2007) and
vesicular transport (Dong et al. 2013) results in tube size defects. Similar defects
in other tubular organs such as the salivary gland have also been observed.
B) Luminal matrix:
The luminal matrix is composed of chitin, a polysaccharide, chitinmodifying
proteins (vermiform and serpentine) (Luschnig et al. 2006), structural
Zona Pellucida domain containing proteins that maintain cell interconnections
(Piopio and Dumpy) and chitin binding proteins such as gasp and obst-A
(Jaźwińska and Affolter 2004; Petkau et al. 2012; Tiklová and Samakovlis 2013a).
These components are synthesized in the tracheal cells and secreted to the lumen
through different routes. For example, the secretion of chitin modifying enzymes,
vermiform (verm) and serpentine (serp) to the tracheal lumen depends on baso
lateral septate junctions (SJ) (Wang et al. 2006). On the other hand, the secretion
of luminal proteins gasp and Piopio depends on MyoV motor-mediated trafficking
along the apical actin cable, but not with the involvement of SJ (Massarwa and
Shilo 2009). Consistent with the role of SJ in apical secretion in the Drosophila
trachea, lethal giant larvae, one of the SJ protein in Drosophila, interacts with the
secretory exocyst complex for polarized apical secretion in MDCK cells (Müsch et
al. 2002). In Drosophila trachea, mutations disrupting chitin biosynthesis
(krotzkopf verkehrt and mummy/cystic) and matrix assembly (knickkopf and18
retroactive) form over-dilated and elongated tubes (Araújo et al. 2005; Devine et
al. 2005; Moussian et al. 2006). Chitin modifications also play an important role in
tube size regulation. For instance, deacetylation of chitin cable is specifically
required to restrict tube over-elongation as shown by the elongated tracheal tubes
in putative chitin deacetylase mutants (verm and serp) (Luschnig et al. 2006).
However, two other chitin binding proteins gasp and obst-A have partially
redundant functions in facilitating the diametric expansion (Tiklová and
Samakovlis 2013b). On the other hand, Pio and Dpy when mutated leads to severe
disruption of branched patterns of trachea as the mutation abolishes organized cell
intercalation and elongation (Jaźwińska and Affolter 2003).
It was recently shown that, in Drosophila hindgut, a glycoprotein named
Tenectin (Tnc) present in the luminal matrix drive tube diametric expansion (Syed
et al. 2012). Interestingly, similar to the luminal matrix in invertebrates, human
endothelial cell capillaries contain a fibrillar luminal matrix. Mature blood vessels
as well as lung epithelia are also lined with an oligosaccharide-based ‘glycocalyx’
(Folkman and Haudenschild 1980). Glycocalyx contains glycosaminoglycans
analogous to chitin and plays an important role in maintaining tube stability
(Reitsma et al. 2007). Hence it will be interesting to investigate if such matrix
components have similar mechanisms of tube size regulation as in invertebrates. 19
C) Endocytosis and Recycling
Apical secretion pulse deposit massive amount of membrane and luminal
materials at the beginning of tube expansion. These proteins are constantly
endocytosed and recycled back (protein turnover) throughout tracheal maturation.
There needs to be a tight co-ordination between endocytic uptake and recycling in
order to maintain optimal protein levels in the membrane and the lumen. Previous
studies show that, cells internalize their cell surface equivalent one to five times
per hour, suggesting that recycling pathways must be robust and fast-paced in
order to cope up with the rapid rate of endocytic uptake.(Grant and Donaldson
2009; Steinman et al. 1983).
Different routes of endocytosis and recycling have been explained recently
in different model systems. Accordingly, there are mainly two categories of
endocytosis, viz. clathrin dependent (CDE) and clathrin independent (CIE)
(Conner and Schmid 2003; Doherty and McMahon 2009). During clathrinmediated
endocytosis, specific cargos at the membrane fuse with clathrin-coated
vesicles (CCVs) (Tsarouhas et al. 2007) . The association of these vesicles with
the plasma membrane is then cleaved by the GTPase dynamin, followed by fusion
of the cargos with early endosomes (containing the Rab family GTPase Rab5)
(Song, Leonard, and Schmid 2004). Even though, CDE is one of the major
conduits of endocytosis, certain cargos do not contain the sequences to be
identified and internalized by clathrin coated vesicles. Such cargos are thought to
be internalized through less well characterized pathways called clathrin 20
independent endocytosis (CIE). However, recent studies suggest multiple routes of
CIE depending on the cell types and cargos, (Mayor and Pagano 2007) making
CIE an intricate recycling system. Some of the CIE pathways are dynamindependent,
whereas some other occurs in dynamin independent fashion but in
Cdc42-, Arf1 and actin-dependent mode (Kumari and Mayor 2008). Another
dynamin-independent mechanism is responsible for endocytosis of many cell
surface membrane integral proteins and dependent on Arf6 GTPase (Mayor and
Pagano 2007; Sandvig et al. 2008). Nevertheless, rapid clearance of luminal
components in Drosophila trachea at stage 17 of embryogenesis is shown to be
dependent on Rab5, dynamin and clathrin (van der Bliek and Meyerowitz 1991;
Wucherpfennig and González-Gaitán 2003). This rapid endocytosis is
indispensable for the proper morphogenesis of trachea. Similar role of Rab5 and
dynamin in mediating endocytosis during morphogenesis of drosophila
photoreceptor cells have also been described earlier (Pinal and Pichaud 2011).
Irrespective of the routes of endocytosis, most of the endocytosed cargos
are delivered to the early endosomes for sorting or immediately recycled back.
From the early endosomes, eventually these cargos follow specific routes for
recycling as revealed by several model systems including Drosophila trachea and
C. elegans intestine. These recycling pathways include but not limited to; 1)
Cargos enter the multi vesicular body (MVB) pathway to reach late endosomes
and later fuse with lysosomes for degradation 2) Some cargos from late
endosomes recycle back to the cell periphery through Trans Golgi Network (TGN) 21
in Rab9 dependent manner (Dong et al. 2013). 3) Rab4 and Rab35 dependent
rapid recycling pathway recycle cargos back to the cell surface directly from early
endosomes. 3) During slow recycling, both CDE and CIE cargos move from the
early endosome to late endosomes and then recycle back to the membrane in a
Rab11 dependent route (Bonifacino and Rojas 2006; Johannes and Popoff 2008).
Both secretory and recycling vesicles travel along the micro tubules in order to get
delivered to the apical membrane. At the periphery of the cell, these recycling
multi complex vesicles break up and the cargos fuse with cell membrane in Arf6,
Rab11, Par3, Cdc42 and cortical actin dependent mechanism. (Grant and
Donaldson 2009). Myosin Vb is also a cytoskeletal motor protein that normally
functions in vesicular transport to the apical membrane in a Rab11 dependent
fashion in Drosophila (Jin et al. 2011; B. X. Li and Ready 2007; Massarwa and
Shilo 2009). Asymmetric distribution of docking and membrane fusion machinery
(SNARE) at the apical and basolateral membranes possibly regulate the polarized
delivery in epithelial cells (Kreitzer et al. 2003). Such polarized transport of
proteins are crucial for the proper structure and function of the organs. For
example, Variant Microvillus Inclusion Disease is an autosomal recessive genetic
disease in human beings caused by mutation of Syntaxin 3, a gene encodes one of
the SNARE proteins. Syntaxin3 is important for the apical delivery in intestine.
This disease is characterized by the inability to deliver proteins to the apical
plasma membrane of the intestine and results in malabsorption of nutrients from
the intestine during infancy (Wiegerinck et al. 2014). 22
Apparently, in Drosophila mutations in genes required for the formation of
CCV (clathrin heavy chain, dynamin, and a novel gene wurst) and the early
endosome (rab5) show over-elongated and over- dilated tubes with defective
apical matrix and apical membrane organization (Tsarouhas et al. 2007; Wingen et
al. 2009). In addition, in Rab9 mutants, specific luminal matrix protein serp is
depleted at later stages leading to elongated tubes (Dong et al. 2013; Zuo et al.
2013). Hence, balanced internalization and recycling of membrane and matrix
components are critical for tube-size regulation. Interestingly, wurst protein is
evolutionally conserved and exhibit a single ortholog in human beings (Wingen et
al. 2009). This indicates a possible putative role of wurst ortholog and other
endocytic pathway components in clinically relevant endocytic defects, such as
neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. With this background it is wise to
anticipate that besides the early secretion pulse, the later steps of endocytosis and
recycling also play critical role in tube-size regulation by maintaining specific
luminal and membrane proteins during tube maturation. In short, when the apical
secretion pathway is required for apical membrane expansion and matrix
formation during tube dilation, the endocytic recycling pathway retains proper
levels of membrane and matrix components to maintain apical membrane size and
luminal matrix components. Therefore, the proper balance between secretion
internalization and recycling is critical to control tube-size. Even though, pathways
of endocytic recycling have been studied elaborately in other model systems, in
Drosophila trachea such mechanisms are largely unknown. 23
D) Apico-basal polarity
Epithelial tubes are generally made up of polarized epithelial cells. Tracheal
cells in Drosophila acquire cell polarity even before tracheal cell specification.
Cell polarity plays a critical role in tube-size regulation in Drosophila trachea. In
both invertebrate as well as vertebrate epithelial cells, apical and basal polarity is
attained through differential distribution of polarity proteins (Fig. 3). In
Drosophila trachea the apical domain contains the Crumbs complex and the Par
complex. The Crumbs complex contains the apical transmembrane protein
Crumbs, which interacts and forms a complex with Stardust (Pals1 in vertebrates),
Patj, Lin7, dmoesin (ezrin, radixin and moesin in vertebrates) and Yurt. The Par
complex contains atypical protein kinase C, its regulator subunit Par6, the small
GTPase Cdc42, and the scaffolding protein Bazooka (Par3 in vertebrates). In
Drosophila trachea, adherens junction separates apical membrane domains from
the basolateral membrane domains by forming a belt around apical pole of
epithelial cells. Two major components of AJ include armadillo (β-catenin in
vertebrates) and DE-cadherin (Oda et al. 1994). The basolateral domain contains
the septate junction (SJ) which is analogous to the vertebrate tight junction (TJ)
and forms a diffusion barrier to prevent the leakage of solutes across epithelia
(Tepass et al. 2001). SJ is formed of polarity proteins such as Sinuous ,
Megatrachea, Kune-kune, Lethal giant larvae, Discs large, Scribble, Yurt, Coracle,
Na+/K+-ATPase, Neurexin IV, Lachesin, and Varicose (Baumgartner et al. 1996; 24
Behr and Schuh 2003; Hough et al. 1997; Laprise et al. 2010; Marta Llimargas et
al. 2004; Müsch et al. 2002; Nelson and Beitel 2010; Padash-Barmchi et al. 2013;
Paul and Beitel 2007; Swanson et al. 2009; Wu et al. 2004a, 2004b, 2007;
Yamanaka et al. 2006). Sinuous, Megatrachea, and Kune-kune are homologs of
vertebrate Claudins (Laprise and Tepass 2011; Swanson and Beitel 2006; Wu and
Beitel 2004).

 ATPase, Neurexin IV, Lachesin, Vari, Yurt
and Coracle. Proper distribution of these proteins are important for maintaining
cell polarity. 25
Similar to the ECM and apical membrane components, the establishment
and maintenance of apical-basal polarity proteins depends on general secretion
pathway and endocytic recycling pathway. Polarity proteins control the tracheal
dimensions either by governing the secretion of ECM components verm and serp
or by regulating the apical membrane components. Loss of function mutations in
most SJ components, except Yurt, scribble and Coracle, lead to tube overelongation
by affecting the secretion of chitin modifying enzymes (vermiform and
serpentine) (Wu et al. 2004,Moyer and Jacobs 2008,Paul et al. 2003,Llimargas et
al. 2004,Behr et al. 2003). However, Yurt and Coracle, controls tracheal length by
regulating the apical membrane protein Crumbs (Laprise et al. 2010. (Fig. 3).
However, increasing recent evidences suggest that SJ might also participate in the
secretion of apically secreted proteins through a mechanism which is still
unknown.
E) Planar cell polarity
Planar cell polarity (PCP), which is orthogonal to the axis of apical-basal
polarity, also play a role in tube size regulation. Key PCP pathway components
include: a seven-pass transmembrane receptor, Frizzled (Fz); an adaptor protein
which acts downstream to Fz, Dishevelled (Dsh); a cadherin family member,
Flamingo/Starry night (Fmi/Stan); a four-pass transmembrane protein,
Strabismus/Van Gogh (Stbm/Vang); and cytoplasmic proteins associated with the 26
apical membrane during PCP mediated signaling, Prickle (Pk) and Diego (Dgo)
(Adler 2002; Bastock and Strutt 2007; Klein and Mlodzik 2005; Seifert and
Mlodzik 2007; D. Strutt 2003). The Fz-pathway is conserved between Drosophila
and humans and contribute to develop appropriate polarity in neighboring cells
through cell-cell interactions. First evidence for the role of PCP in regulating
tracheal dimensions came from mutation in Serrano (Sano), a protein that directly
binds to Dsh. Sano mutants exhibited an elongated tracheal DT, whereas overexpression
of Sano in trachea resulted in a shortened DT (Chung et al. 2009).
Furthermore, null mutants of other core PCP genes, fz, dsh and fmi, also show
elongated tubes (Chung et al. 2009). PCP signaling has been implicated in
directing cell morphology, partially through RhoA (D. I. Strutt and Mlodzik
1997). Consistently, RhoA mutants also show elongated tubes (Chung et al. 2009).
This might indicate a potential, RhoA dependent role of PCP signaling in
regulating the cytoskeleton in Drosophila trachea. However, the mechanisms of
PCP proteins in tracheal tube-size regulation are yet to be determined.
F) Apical Cytoskeleton
Microtubules and actin cytoskeleton plays important roles in tube size
regulation. Presence of dense distribution of F-actin at the apical membrane is a
unifying feature of the cells comprising tubular structures. In Drosophila trachea,
actin partake in tube size regulation mainly through two distinct mechanisms; 1)
by providing a track for the myosin motor proteins to carry vesicles containing 27
cargos, 2) actin polymerization itself is required for the apical delivery and
secretion of proteins to the ECM. In epithelial tubes such as Drosophila salivary
gland, trachea, hindgut, and Malpighian tubules, the Formin-Family Protein
Diaphanous (Dia) dependent F-actin formation at the cell cortex is required for the
secretion of luminal proteins through the apical membrane (Massarwa and Shilo
2009). Various studies revealed that localized F-actin morphogenesis is a key step
during membrane endocytosis as well (Engqvist-Goldstein and Drubin 2003;
Smythe and Ayscough 2006). Likewise, the unconventional myosin motor Myosin
V is important for polarized secretion of proteins (Reck-Peterson et al. 2000). In
Drosophila MyoV family is represented by a single gene, myoV (didum) which is
ubiquitously expressed throughout all the developmental stages. Obliterated apical
targeting of secreted proteins were observed in MyoV mutant MDCK cells,
melanocytes and budding yeast (B. X. Li, Satoh, and Ready 2007b). However
basolateral targeting of proteins were not affected in MyoV mutants. Furthermore,
apical secretion of luminal proteins gasp and Pio were completely abolished in
MyoV defective Drosophila trachea. Interestingly, many of the Rab11 loss of
function phenotypes is analogous to MyoV mutation. Additionally, yeast two
hybrid screens revealed a direct interaction of Rab11 with MyoV, specifically to
the 60KD MyoVb tail (Lapierre et al. 2001). Consistent with this finding, genetic
interaction between Myo2p, a class V Myosin with Sec4, a Rab protein in yeast
was observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Schott 1999). 28
Furthermore, Rab11 also has been shown to interact with class I Rab11-
FIPs (Rytis Prekeris 2003). Drosophila contains a single class I FIP, dRip11 (R
Prekeris and Scheller 2000). Both Rab11 and Rip11 are located at the apical
plasma membrane and subapical recycling endosomes (ARE). It was proposed that
dRip11 and Rab11 along with MyoV form a ternary complex and involve in
protein trafficking from ARE to the apical plasma membrane, along polarized
actin filaments (B. X. Li and Ready 2007b; R Prekeris and Scheller 2000). Rab11-
MyoV-FIP1 complex not only involve in endocytic recycling but also for the
apical delivery of proteins emanating from the trans Golgi network (Satoh et al.
2005).
In addition to the proteins involved in apical delivery, other actin binding
proteins such as ERM family members also participate in tube size regulation.
ERM proteins are activated upon phosphorylation and impart structural rigidity to
the epithelial tubes by cross linking actin cytoskeleton with the plasma membrane
(Karagiosis and Ready 2004; Kunda et al. 2008). Consequently, suboptimal levels
of p-Moesin at the apical membrane of tracheal DT and salivary gland leads to
elongated tubes (Cheshire et al. 2008). Drosophila encompass only one, highly
conserved ERM family member, Moesin which localizes predominantly to the
apical membrane of the epithelial cells. However vertebrate ERM proteins
comprise ezrin, radixin and moesin. As augmented Moesin activity correlates with
cortical stiffness, Moesin phosphorylation should be tightly regulated to normalize
epithelial tube size. This regulatory inputs include kinases and phosphatases. The 29
apical polarity protein Crumbs and the Synaptotagmin-Like-Protein family
member Bitesize (Btsz) have been shown to regulate the recruitment of Moesin to
the apical complex (Médina et al. 2002; Pilot et al. 2006). Sterile-20 like kinase
Slik, is a kinase distributed at the apical membrane of cells similar to p-Moesin,
and shown to be responsible for the phosphorylation of Moesin in imaginal discs,
S2 cells and Drosophila trachea (Hipfner and Cohen 2004; Ukken et al. 2014a).
However, Breathless, an FGF receptor activates Moesin only at the terminal cells
of tracheal cells through a mechanism independent of canonical MAPK pathway
(Ukken et al. 2014b).
Several other kinases responsible for Moesin phosphorylation were
explained recently, out of which Rho kinase (Rok) have been studied elaborately
in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Rok is one of the downstream effectors of
Rho1 (RhoA in mammals). RhoA has shown to regulate actin cytoskeleton by
activating or phosphorylating Moein in mammalian cell lines (Matsui et al. 1998;
Shaw et al. 1998). Even though, in Drosophila salivary gland, Rho1 negatively
regulates Moesin phosphorylation during morphogenesis (Xu et al. 2011),
depletion of Rho1 activity in S2 cells moderately reduce Moesin phosphorylation
(Hipfner and Cohen 2004). Remarkably, there has been evidence describing the
existence of a negative feedback loop between Moesin activation and the activity
of Rho pathway (Speck et al. 2003). Similarly slik mutants also exhibit an
enhanced Rho1 activity (Hipfner and Cohen 2004). These observations suggest
that, regulation of Moesin activity by Rho1 is organ specific. 30

Invitro transcription and generation of dig labelled Dmo RNA probe
Dysmorphic RNA probe was generated through invitro transcription. PCR
amplification of Dmo cDNA cloned into the pFlc-1 vector was carried out using
the SK-30 (5′ GGG-TAA-CGC-CAG-GGT-TTT-CC 3′) and SK-Met (5′ ATGACC-ATG-ATT-ACG-CCA-AGC
3′) primers. To generate antisense dig- RNA
probe for the cloned cDNA, 50µl of PCR product was ethanol precipitated,
resuspended in DEPC-treated H2O, and transcribed using T3 (Promega)
polymerase. The reactions was performed at 37°C for 3hr and contained the
following: 1× transcription buffer, 10mM DTT, 1× nucleotide labeling mix
(Roche) containing dig-UTP, 20 units RNasin (Promega), and 8 units of RNA
polymerase in a 10µl final volume. RNA probes were DNase-treated with 1µl of
RQ1 DNase (Promega) for 30 min at 37°C. Probes are ethanol precipitated and are
resuspended in 100µl of probe resuspension buffer (50% formamide, 5mM Tris–
HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.01% Tween-20).
Fluorescence in situ hybridization
Approximately 500 Btl-mCD8-GFP embryos (encompassing stages 12–17)
were hybridized with the Dmo RNA probe. Probe was diluted 1:100 in
hybridization buffer (50% glycerol, 4× SSC, 5% dextran sulfate, 0.01% Tween-
20) and hybridization was performed in a total volume of 100µl at 55°C overnight.
Hybridized embryos were blocked in 0.5% blocking buffer (Perkin Elmer) and 34
incubated in anti-dig-POD antibody (Roche) diluted 1:50 in 0.5% blocking buffer
for 1 hr. Following three 10 min PT (1× PBS, 0.1% Tween-20) washes, embryos
were incubated for 2 hr in TSA-Cy3 diluted in amplification diluent (Perkin
Elmer). TSA reactions were stopped by three PT washes. Fluorescent RNA probe
development was followed by immuno-staining. The 1° antibodies rat-α-Trh and
ck-α-GFP at 1:100 dilution and secondary antibodies α-ck-488 and α-Rat-647 at
1:100 dilution were used for the immunolabeling of tracheal membrane and
nucleus.
Embryo fixation
Embryos were fixed in different fixatives such as formaldehyde,
paraformaldehyde or by heat fixation depending on the antibodies used for
immuno staining. Distinct fixation method was adopted for Phalloidin staining.
Before fixation the embryos were dechorionated in 50% bleach in water (Clorox –
regular bleach) for 5min and washed thoroughly with water.
A) Formaldehyde fixation: After dechorionation the embryos were fixed
using 4% formaldehyde in 1X PBS and heptane (1:1) for 20-30 minutes. Embryos
were then devitalized by vigorously shaking in 1:1 methanol and heptane and
washed in methanol 3 times. Embryos were stored in -200C until used for
immuno-staining. 35
B) Paraformaldehyde fixation: Dechorionated embryos were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in 1X PBS and heptane (1:1) for 10-20 minutes followed by
devitalization of embryos by vigorously shaking in 1:1 80% ethanol and heptane
mixture. Embryos were then washed in 100% ethanol 3 times and stored in 100%
ethanol at -200C degree until used for immuno-staining.
C) Heat fixation: Dechorionated embryos were rinsed thoroughly with
water. 10ml boiling hot Triton X100 salt solution (TSS: 70mM NaCl and 0.03%
TritonX100) was added to the embryos in a glass scintillation vial. Embryos were
swirled for 15 sec. 10ml ice cold TSS solution was added to the embryos and
incubated for 20 min on ice. The solution was removed and the embryos were
treated with 50% methanol in heptane. After vigorous shaking the embryos were
collected from the bottom of the vial and washed in methanol 3 times. Embryos
were stored at -200C for atleast 2 days before using for immunostaining.
D) Fixation for phalloidin staining: Fix solution was prepared two days
prior to fixation using 37% formaldehyde and heptane (1:1) with periodic shaking
to mix contents. While fixing, dechorionated embryos were incubated for 30 min
in heptane saturated with formaldehyde (upper layer). After the incubation,
embryos were transferred to a scintillation vial containing 100% heptane and kept
overnight at -200C. Embryos were then transferred to a standard tape slide
allowing the embryos to stick to the tape. To prevent dehydration of embryos 1X
PBS was added and then vitelline membrane was removed using a scalpel. 36
Devitalized embryos were transferred to fresh PBT and proceeded to
immunostaining.
Immunohistochemistry
A) Regular staining: Embryos were subjected to immuno staining soon
after or a few days after fixation. For the regular immunostaining embryos were
washed in PT (1xPBS, 0.1% Triton X-100) 3x 10min, and blocked in PBT-NGS
(1xPBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% Normal Goat Serum (NGS) for
30min. Embryos were incubated in 1° antibody diluted in PBT-NGS overnight at
4°C, washed 3x 10min, then 3x 20min in PBT, and blocked for 30min in PBTNGS.
Embryos were then incubated in 2° antibody diluted in PBT-NGS (1:100)
for 2 hr at room temperature, washed 3x 10min and 3x 20min in PBT. Embryos
mounted in 100% glycerol were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse Ti confocal
microscope.
B) Tyramide Signal Amplification (TSA) immunostaining: Fixed embryos
were washed in PT (1xPBS, 0.1% Trition X-100) 3x 10min, blocked in PBT-NGS
(1xPBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.1% Trition X-100, 5% Normal Goat Serum (NGS) for
30min. Embryos were incubated in 1° antibody diluted in PBT-NGS overnight at
4°C, washed 3x 10 min, then 3x 20 min in PBT, blocked for 30min in PBT-NGS.
Embryos were then incubated in Biotin labelled 2° antibody (Vector laboratories)
diluted in PBT-NGS (1:300) for 1hr at room temperature, washed 3x 10 min, and
3x 20 min in PBT. Embryos were incubated in streptavidin conjugated HRP 37
(Perkin Elmer) diluted in 1X PBT (1:100), washed 3x 5min, then 3x 10min in
PBT. Treated with TSA fluorescein (TSA cyanine 3/TSA cyanine 5/ TSA
fluorescein; 1:50 dilution in amplification diluent) for 10 min in dark, washed
3x10 min, then 3x20 min in PBT. Embryos were mounted in 100% glycerol and
images were obtained using a Nikon Eclipse Ti confocal microscope.
cDNA synthesis and sequencing
To generate dysmorphic cDNA, total RNA was extracted from the embryos
using RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Oligotex (Qiagen) was utilized to extract Poly
(A) +
mRNA from total RNA using oligo dT primers. First stand cDNA was
synthesized using SuperScript® reverse transcriptase (Gibco-BRL). RNase H and
DNA polymerase executed the second strand synthesis. Forward and reverse
primers specific to dysmorphic was utilized for the amplification of cDNA
through PCR. Primer sequence required /amplified fragment size, The cDNA was
then cloned to pCR2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen) transformed to DH5α E.Coli
cells, plasmid was isolated using plasmid midi kit(100) (Qiagen) and sequenced
(Research technology support facility, Michigan state university, E. Lansing). 38
Transgenesis
UAS-HA-Dmo and UAS-HA-dRip flies were generated through transgenic
technology. In order to generate these flies Dmo and dRip cDNA fragments
without ATG start codon were PCR amplified and cloned into pCR8/GW/TOPO
(Invitrogen) vector. The cloned plasmid was then transformed to DH5α competent
cells. Plasmid purification was performed using Plasmid miniprep kit (Qiagen).
Plasmid was digested using RESTRICTION ENZYMES and the digested product
was run on an agarose gel to separate the fragments. The insert was purified from
the gel using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and cloned to pAHW, an HA
tag containing Gateway compatible vector (http://www.ciwemb.edu/labs/murphy),
using gateway LR Clonase II plus (Invitrogen) HA-Dmo and HA-dRip were then
PCR amplified and cloned back to pCR8/GW/TOPO. The following primers were
used for PCR: Forward : and Reverse: . The plasmid was then transformed to
DH5α, purified and the insert was cloned into P-element vector pT, another
Drosophila Gateway compatible vector containing an upstream UAS sequence,
using Gateway LR Clonase II. The transgenes, UAS-HA-Dmo and UAS-HA-dRip
were then introduced into the Drosophila germline through microinjection.
Chromosome location of the transgene was also determined.
Confocal microscopy and Morphometric analysis
Followed by immunostaining, embryos were mounted in 100% glycerol.
Stage14 to Stage16 embryos were imaged using Nikon Eclipse Ti confocal 39
microscope. Z-stack projections were acquired using EZ-Z1 program and the
obtained optical sections were merged using Nikon NLS Elements program.
Comparison of protein distribution between different embryos was done by fixing
the laser gain and intensity at specific points.
The DT length and diameter were determined by measuring the apical
membrane labelled with uif using NIS Elements program. We used at least 6 each
embryos of wild type and Dmo mutants at each stages from 14 to 16. Results are
represented in bar graphs as the mean ± standard deviation. Both the diameter and
length were measured for each metameres separately from 4th (anterior) to 8th
(posterior) tracheal segments. Tube length was estimated by tracing the apical
localization of the uif along each segment. For the diametric measurement the
lowest, median and highest measurements of each metameres were taken. The DT
length and diameter were expressed as the mean plus standard deviation (SD).
Statistical significance was analyzed using student’s t-test.
Protein purification and antibody production
A polyclonal antibody was generated against Dmo. For this, Dmo fragment
corresponding to amino acids 233-333 was PCR amplified using Dmo cDNA as
template. Primers used for PCR include, forward primer having Pst1 restriction
site; 5’-CTGCAGCAAACGATTCCCAAGTCACTG-3’ (Pst1 restriction site is
underlined) and reverse primer having EcoR1restriction site; 5’-40
GAATTCTTACTGCGACCCGCTGCTCTT-3’ (EcoR1 restriction site is
underlined). Both amplified Dmo fragment and hexa histidine-tag containing
pTrcHisC vector (Invitrogen) was then digested using Pst1 and EcoR1 restriction
enzymes at 370C for 2hrs, separated on 1% agarose gel and gel purified (Qiaquick
Gel Extraction Kit), recombined using T7 ligase (NEB). The purified recombinant
DNA was transformed to BL21DE3 expression cells. Single colony was then
cultured O/N, expression of 6X His tagged Dmo protein fragment was induced by
the addition of 1mM IPTG at 180C for 2 hr, centrifuged to collect pellet, sonicated
the cells in lysis buffer (300mM NaH2PO4, 10mM imidazole, 1mM DTT, 1mg/ml
Lysozyme, protease inhibitor cocktail, 0.1% NP40, 15% Glycerol), lysate was
incubated with Ni-NTA resin (Biorad) O/N, packed in a column, washed with
50ml wash buffer ( 50mM NaH2PO4, 300mM NaCl, 20mM imidazole, 1mM
DTT) and eluted the protein using high imidazole containing elution buffer
(50mM NaH2PO4, 300mM NaCl, 500mM imidazole, 1mM DTT). The eluted
His6-Dmo protein was dialyzed in two changes of 1X PBS containing 0.01% DTT.
Two rats were then immunized by subcutaneous injection of the protein (PoconoRabbit
Farm & Laboratory) to generate antibody.
P-element imprecise excision
To generate deletion mutant of Dmo, approximately 100
P{GawB}MCPH1NP6229 virgin females were crossed to about 100 jump starter yw; 41
P[w+ ; ∆2-3] males. The resultant male progenies (about 200) w; P{GawB}
MCPH1NP6229 / P[w+ ; ∆2-3] were then mated with yw; Pin/Cyo virgin females
(about 200). Single crosses of the resulting white- eyed males were performed
with w; Pin/Cyo P [w+
; twi-GFP] females. Likewise, approximately 500 single
crosses were established. PCR analysis of the GFP –ve F3 embryos were carried
out using Dmo exon1 specific primers. After the screening of all 500 crosses, two
Dmo mutants were isolated: Dmo
64 and Dmo
86. Exact break point of the mutants
were analyzed using different exon and intron specific PCRs and confirmed
through sequencing.
Co-immunoprecipitation
Wild type and UAS-HA-Dmo embryos were used to perform coimmunoprecipitation.
Embryos were dechorionated in bleach for 3min, washed
thoroughly in water and approximately 200μl embryos were transferred to a 1.5ml
eppendorf tube containing PT (1xPBS, 0.1% Trition X-100). 600μl lysis buffer
(50mM Hepes KOH pH 7.5, 50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 150mM NaCl, 0.03% Np40,
0.005% SDC, 1mM PMSF, 1tablet protease inhibitor (Rosche), 50% Glycerol and
made the total volume to 10ml using ddH2O) was added to the embryos and left
on ice for 20 min. Embryos were then sonicated 4X 10 sec with 1 min gap, spun
maximum speed for 5 min at 40C centrifuge, removed the upper fatty layer and
collected the supernatant. Protein concentration was measured using Bradford 42
assay, equalized the concentration of both wild type and UAS-HA-Dmo samples.
Meanwhile HA beads (Sigma) were washed in BSA/lysis (1μl 10XBSA in 5ml
lysis buffer) 2X 5 min at 40C and blocked in BSA/lysis for 30 min. After blocking
150μl BSA/lysis was added to the beads and split the beads equally in two
different tubes. Equal amounts of wild type and UAS-HA-Dmo lysate were added
to the beads along with 100μl each binding buffer (200mM Hepes KOH pH 7.5,
800mM KOAc, 54mM Mg (OA)2, 0.1% Np40 100% , 40% Glycerol, 5mM
PMSF, 1/4th tablet protease inhibitor (Rosche) and make up the volume to 1ml
using ddH2O) and incubated O/N at 40C. Next day, the beads were spun down at
2500rpm for 1 min, removed supernatant and washed beads in wash buffer1
(10mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2 and 0.01% Np40) 2X 1min and wash buffer2 (10mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.2 , 0.01% Np40 and 60mM NaCl) 2X 1min on ice. Removed the
supernatant and eluted the protein in 100μl sample buffer and proceeded to
western blot using protein specific antibodies.

added to the protein lysate in 1:1 dilution, boiled for 10 min at 950C, centrifuged at
12K rpm for 5 min. Samples were loaded on to 10% polyacrylamide gel along
with Precision Plus Protein Dual Color Standard (Bio-rad). After SDS-PAGE,
protein was transferred to Nitrocellulose Membrane (Bio-rad) and subjected to 43

CHAPTER THREE
RESULTS
Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) which is a consortium of the
Drosophila Genome Center provides information about the predicted genes and
DNA sequence along with the expression pattern in Drosophila melanogaster44
(insitu.fruitfly.org). CG13183 (CG refers to computed gene; the unique CG
numbers are often used to denote the unnamed genes) is originally predicted as a
gene located on the 2nd chromosome in the fly genome. CG13183 was later
named as Dysmorphic (Dmo) by our lab ascribing to the tracheal phenotype shown
by its loss of function mutation. Gene expression database shows that, Dmo is
expressed mainly in trachea, hypopharynx and epidermis of the fly embryos
(insitufruitfly.org). In order to confirm the expression of Dmo in trachea, I
performed Fluorescent insitu hybridization (FISH) using fluorescently labeled digRNA
probe specific to Dmo transcript. FISH shows that the gene is expressed
mainly in the dorsal trunk (DT) cells and at the proximal part of the transverse
connective (TC) of the trachea with a minimal expression in unicellular branches
such as Lateral Trunk (LT), Ganglionic Branch (GB), Visceral Branch (VB) and
Dorsal Branch (DB). This gene expression pattern is consistent with the gene
expression database. Dmo expression begins at stage13 of embryogenesis and
continue throughout embryogenesis till stage17. However there is an upregulation
of Dmo expression in the tracheal fusion cells at early stages (stage 13 through 15)
compared to rest of the multicellular tracheal cells. At stages16 through 17, all
tracheal cells in the multicellular tubes exhibit similar level of expression. Dmo is
located at 48C5-48D2 on the 2nd chromosome in the fly genome with specific
sequence location 2R:11,904,323...11,912,779 (flybase.org). 45

is shown for stage 14 (S14) (A & YZ[ ) and Stage 15 (S15) (B & \Z[ ) embryos.

mCD8-GFP protein (green)]Z^YZ[Z_Z\Z[ ) mCD8-GFP labels the tracheal cell
membrane (green) of all tracheal branches]Z^YZ[Z_Z\Z[ ) Dmo RNA distribution
indicates that the gene is expressed mainly in the tracheal dorsal trunk (DT) and
transverse connective (TC) with minimal expression in unicellular and subcellular
branches.
The predicted DNA sequence of a gene may not always be accurate. Hence
I isolated the embryonic genomic RNA of W1118 (wild type) flies and performed a
reverse transcriptase PCR using gene specific and oligo dT primers. Further
sequencing of the cDNA obtained showed two different splice variants of Dmo,
unlike the single predicted transcript. The difference between the two splice
variants lies in the insertion of about 113 nucleotides in transcript B between
nucleotide position 919 and 1033 of transcript A.46
Sequence analysis of the coding region also indicates the presence of an
evolutionary conserved MH2 domain of Smad proteins. Smad proteins are
generally 400 – 500 amino acids long and have highly conserved N- terminal
MH1 (Mad homology1) and C- terminal MH2 (Mad homology domain 2)
domains (Heldinet al.1997). The MH2 domain is the protein–protein interacting
domain and MH1, the DNA binding domain. Dmo protein is 431 amino acids long
which is typical of smad proteins. However, the protein lacks highly conserved
MH1 domain of typical smads. Phylogenetic analysis of MH2 domain of the
protein indicates that Dmo is closely related to Drosophila Expansion protein, the
C. elegans protein C34E11.2c and distantly related to one of the uncharacterized
human protein Hum-BAH12971.

(CG13183). (A) Schematic representation of location of Dmo on 2nd chromosome

flybase.org). (B) Dmo protein is 431 amino acid long and contains a conserved

corresponding to amino acids 229-431 (shown with red line). (C) Phylogenetic

Dmo is closely related to Drosophila Expansion protein, the C. elegans protein

Dmo is localized in the cytoplasm and apical membrane
To examine the localization of Dmo in tracheal cells, antibody was
generated against non-conserved 15KD region of the Dmo protein. Unfortunately
the antibody did not recognize Dmo in vivo. As a second approach, I created UASHA-
Dmo transgenic lines. HA-Dmo was expressed in tracheal cells using BtlGap-GFP.
Gap being a membrane protein allowed to label the cell membrane
using α-GFP. Localization of Dmo was analyzed using α-HA antibody by
comparing against membranous Gap-GFP and nuclear protein Trh. HA-Dmo was
found localized mainly at the apical membrane of tracheal cells along with some
cytoplasmic localization. However, there was no co-localization found with the
nuclear marker Trh. These findings suggest that Dmo protein is membranous as
well as cytoplasmicZ^`abcdeZf\-\Z[ZghiZfj-jZ[ ).
Functional analysis of Dmo
To understand the role of Dmo in tracheal development, I generated loss of
function and gain of function mutants of Dmo. Loss of function mutation is
created by excision of P-element located upstream (5’) to Dmo. The imprecise
excision of P-element generated two deletion mutants of Dmo. Analysis of the
tracheal morphology in mutants, using the tracheal apical membrane marker
uninflatable (uif) displayed an elongated tracheal dorsal trunk with irregular
diameter. However, unicellular branches such as LT and GB showed no obvious
defects. Out of two mutants generated, Dmo
∆64 removes entire coding region 50
(exons 1to 6) of Dmo and two other downstream (3’) neighboring genes, MCPH1
and EFLA1. However, the deleted neighboring genes are not tracheal expressed
genes, which indicate that, the tracheal phenotype in Dmo
∆64 mutants is merely
due to the deletion of Dmo. As expected, FISH analysis shows no Dmo mRNA
transcripts in the Dmo
∆64 trachea. The second mutant generated was Dmo
∆86 in
which only exon1 of the Dmo gene is removed leaving all the neighboring genes
intact. Dmo
∆86 trachea also shows similar phenotype as Dmo
∆64. Interestingly,
exon1 does not encode the starting codon. This indicate that, exon1 might
comprise a regulatory region vital for the gene function. Accordingly western blot
analysis of the embryo lysate of Dmo
∆64 and Dmo
∆86, using α-dmo antibody
showed complete absence of dmo protein in both lysates as opposed to the W 1118
.
(Figure 7D). Overall, in Dmo
∆64 mutant entire coding region of Dmo along with
two neighboring genes, MCPH1 and EFLA1 are deleted and thus acts as null
mutant. Whereas, in Dmo
∆86, exon1 and a part of intron1 is removed (Figure 7A).
In order to confirm that, tracheal phenotype in Dmo
∆64 mutants are solely due to
the deletion of Dmo, and not due to deletion of other neighboring genes, a Dmo
rescue experiment was performed. For this, UAS-Dmo was expressed in the
mutant background of Dmo
∆64, using Btl-gal4 driver and checked whether the
phenotype could be completely rescued. As expected there was a complete rescue
of the mutant phenotype and trachea looked similar to that of W1118 (Figure 8C &
8c).51

solid black boxes indicate dmo exons, black lines in between the exons represent
the introns. Blue boxes represents the neighboring genes and the black arrow point

p-element was assumed to be mobilized potentially by transposase enzyme and the
flies were analyzed for any deletions in the genomic region of dmo by using PCR.
The middle panel represents the dmo genomic region in Dmo
∆64 flies. Shown is the
deletion of genomic region of dmo starting from the p-element insertion site at 5’

in Dmo

insertion along with exon 1 and a part of intron 1 of dmo are deleted. (B)

and shown in the W1118 lane. However, it is completely absent from both Dmo
∆64
and Dmo
∆86. β-actin is used as a loading control. 53
Next, in order to analyze whether enhanced Dmo expression also results in
tracheal defects as in loss of function mutants, I generated over expression Dmo
transgenic lines. The over expression transgenic lines, UAS-HA-Dmo lines were
then crossed to Btl-Gal4 flies to specifically enhance the Dmo expression in
tracheal cells alone. Phenotypic analysis of the trachea in such embryos did not
show any significant disparity from the wild type (W1118) trachea. This shows
that Dmo plays a permissive role rather than an instructive role in tracheal tube
size regulation.
Apical membrane length of tracheal cells is increased in Dmo mutants.
Smad proteins function mostly as mediators of TGF-β signaling. TGF- β
signaling have shown to play a role in branch specification and cell migration
(Chen et al. 1998) in Drosophila trachea. It has also been shown to regulate cell
number in zebra fish as a mean to control tube size in cranial vessels (Roman, et
al. 2002). Nevertheless, loss of function and gain of function TGF- β mutants
exhibit no obvious tube size defects. (Chen et al 1998; Myat et al. 2005)
However, in Dmo mutants, tracheal branch identity is not compromised which
indicates that this gene is not required for early patterning of the trachea. Total
number of tracheal cells also remain similar in mutants compared to the wild type,
as shown by the Trachealess (Trh), a tracheal specific nuclear marker. This
indicates that the elongated trachea in Dmo mutants is not resulted from an 54
increase in cell number. Overall these observations suggest that, Dmo could be an
atypical smad protein with functions divergent from other smad proteins. Next, I
examined other possibilities that could lead to tube over elongation such as apical
membrane length and cell size. Analysis of apical membrane by immunostaining
of apical marker uninflatable (uif) and apical crumbs (Crb) shows a more wavy
apical membrane in the mutants compared to more or less straight membrane in
wild type embryos. Accordingly the cell size of the tracheal cells also increased as
indicated by the DE-cadherin (DE-cad) localization, one of the adherent junction
(AJ) components. Therefore, the increased tube length in Dmo mutants might have
resulted from an increase in length of the apical membrane of the tracheal cells.
These observations describe Dmo as an atypical smad protein and suggest that it
may not function as a mediator of TGF- β signaling. The tracheal elongation and
diameter phenotype for each tracheal segments in the dysmorphic mutants were
quantified against W1118. Out of 15 each wild type and mutants embryos
analyzed, there were approximately 15% increase in the DT length in mutants
compared to the wild type.5556
Figure 8. The multicellular tube DT is over-elongated with irregular diameter in

range between 0-0.3 μm. For all three Dmo

tracheal segments range between 0.1-1.5 μm. (E) Increased length of the DT in

type embryos. Average increase in length of 10 mutant embryos vs 10 wild type
embryos are shown as a graphical representation. In segments 4-7, there was
approximately 15% increase from 108.2 μm in wild type to 126.2 μm in Dmo
mutants. DT: Dorsal Trunk. 57
Dmo does not function as a regulator of TGF-β signaling pathway in
Drosophila trachea.
Dmo belongs to the Smad family of proteins. Smad proteins are regulators
(e.g., such as with Dad) of TGF-β signaling (Kamiya, et al. 2008). To test this
possibility, we analyzed the effect of Dmo on TGF-β signaling mutant phenotype
by expressing Dmo in constitutively active or loss of function TGF-β signaling
mutants. If Dmo regulates TGF-β signaling, expressing Dmo in these mutants will
either suppress or enhance the mutant phenotype. Overactive TGF-β signaling by
expressing TkvQ253D in trachea using btl-gal4 caused defects in DT migration
(Fig. 4D) compared to control (Fig. 4A). TGF-β loss of function mutant punt135
had defects in DB formation (Fig. 4B). However, Dmo expression in TkvQ253D
over-expressed trachea (Fig. 4E) or punt135 mutant trachea (Fig. 4C) neither
suppressed nor enhanced the mutant phenotypes. Thus, similar to Exp, Dmo does
not function as a typical Smad by regulating TGF-β signaling.
Dmo is required for the maintenance of luminal matrix components
Luminal components have shown to play an important role in tube size
regulation. Tracheal luminal matrix components include, chitin, a polysaccharide,
chitin deacetylases vermiform (verm) and serpentine (serp), chitin binding proteins
gasp (2A12) and obst-A, and a zona pellucida domain containing protein Piopio
(pio). Chitin is synthesized in tracheal cells and begins to accumulate in the 58
tracheal lumen by stage13 of embryogenesis. At stage 14 chitin deacetylases serp
and verm are secreted into the lumen and helps in maintaining fibrillar structure of
chitin. (Luschnig et al. 2006). At the same time presence of luminal chitin is
required for the secretion of these deacetylases into the lumen (Luschnig et
al.2006). The interaction between the chitin deacetylases and chitin is important
for restricting the tube length of the trachea. It was also shown that genes in chitin
biosynthetic pathway when mutated results in defective amounts of luminal gasp
(Devine et al. 2005). Whereas, obst-A and gasp over expression exhibit irregular
diametric expansion of tracheal dorsal trunk (Tiklová and Samakovlis 2013) and
both proteins exhibit functional redundancy. To test whether Dmo regulates tube
size by controlling the secretion or maintenance of luminal matrix components,
immunohistochemical analysis of chitin, verm, serp, obst-A and gasp were
performed. In Dmo mutants, chitin, chitin deacetylases, obst-A and gasp showed
normal secretion as indicated by the proper localization of these components in the
lumen at early stages of embryogenesis. However the luminal abundance of these
proteins were reduced significantly at later stages when compared to the wild type
embryos. Surprisingly, a much severe phenotype was observed for obst-A protein
compared to other proteins in that obst-A showed a drastic reduction from the
lumen at later stages in Dmo mutants. These observations indicate that Dmo might
play a role in the proper accumulation of these proteins specifically obst-A, in the
lumen at later stages by either controlling the luminal maintenance or by
regulating the protein turnover or recycling. On the other hand, another matrix 59
protein Piopio showed no obvious difference from that of wild type. This
indicates that dysmorphic only affects cargo specific secretion or recycling of
certain luminal proteins at later stages of embryogenesis.

and Dmo

and luminal proteins gasp (blue- G & G’) and verm (red- H & H’) were secreted
normally to the DT lumen in Dmo
∆64 (E’,G’,H’) similar to wild type (E,G,H). At
late stage15, luminal chitin (I & I’), gasp (K & K’) and verm (L & L’) localization
was reduced in Dmo
∆64 (I’, K’, L’) when compared to the wild type (I, K, L). The
decrease in localization of these components in Dmo
∆64 were persisted (chitin- M’,
gasp-O’, verm-P’) and were more severe during stage 16 compared to wild type
(chitin- M, gasp-O, verm-P) control of similar stage. 62
Junctional components are not altered in dysmorphic mutants.
Septate junction (SJ) has been shown to partake in the secretion of verm
and serp to the luminal extra cellular matrix. In addition, mutants in SJ display
tube over-elongation phenotype similar to dysmorphic mutants. SJ appear as a
ladder-like group of septa basal to the cadherin-based adherens junctions. SJs have
been implicated in tube-size regulation by different mechanisms. One group
including the Na+/K+-ATPas (α and β subunits), Nrx-IV, Lachesin (Lac), Sinuous
(Sinu), Megatrachea (Mega) and varicose (Vari) controls tube length by
controlling the secretion of luminal matrix proteins verm and serp. Another group,
Yurt, Coracle and Sribble restricts tube over-elongation thorough a luminal matrix
independent pathway. Yurt and Corcle directly inhibits the over-expression of
apical membrane protein Crumbs and Sribble inhibits tube elongation thorough an
unknown pathway (Fig. 9A). To investigate the possibility that Dmo is required
for normal distribution of septate junction proteins, I analyzed the distribution of a
subset of SJ components in Dmo mutants and wild type embryos including;
Sinuous, varicose, kune-kune, yurt, coracle, nrv2.1, DLG and Fasciclin III.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed comparable distribution and localization
of these components in Dmo mutants compared to the wild type embryos. These
observations indicate that Dmo maintains the abundance of luminal components
through a mechanism that may not involve SJ components. 63

Reduced apical localization of Rab11 in dysmorphic mutants
Secretion of ECM components are unaffected at early stages in Dmo
mutants suggesting that Dmo may not regulate secretion of ECM components.
However, proper levels of luminal proteins are maintained in the tracheal lumen at
later stages through Rab mediated endocytosis and recycling. In Dmo mutant
luminal abundance of proteins are reduced only at later stages, proposing a
possibility that Dmo regulates recycling or protein turnover of luminal
components at later stages. A similar scenario was described earlier for one of the
luminal proteins serp, where the protein abundance was normal at early stage but
reduced at later stages when the functioning of one of the recycling endosome
Rab9 was impaired (Dong et al. 2013). This further strengthen the anticipation that
Dmo might regulate protein recycling. Therefore, known components of the
recycling pathway was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. No significant
change has been observed in the localization or abundance of Golgi and ER in
mutants compared to the wild type, suggesting that dysmorphic mutants do not
exhibit defects in general vesicular trafficking machinery. Small GTPase Rab11 is
a recycling endosome marker that has shown to play an important role in targeted
delivery of vesicles carrying cargos from late endosomes to membrane during
protein recycling or turnover (Pelissier et al., 2003; Saraste and Goud, 2007; Satoh
et al., 2005; Strickland and Burgess, 2004). In normal polarized epithelia, Rab11
localizes to both apical recycling endosomes (Hoekstra et al., 2004) and apically-65
targeted secretory vesicles emerging directly from Golgi (Satoh et al. 2005) and
late endosomes. Immuno histochemical analysis of trachea in Dmo mutants
displayed a greatly reduced apical localization of Rab11during later stages of
embryogenesis, while retaining the normal cytoplasmic localization. Rab11 has
shown to be important for DE-cadherin mediated inhibition of cell intercalation in
tracheal DT during lumen formation (Bryant et al. 2010; Datta and Mostov 2011;
Desclozeaux et al. 2008; Ribeiro and Affolter 2004; Shaye and Llimargas 2008)
and to facilitate recycling of apical determinant crumb in epidermis and DEcadherin
in trachea (Roeth et al. 2009; Desclozeaux et al. 2008). Hence, I
examined, if reduced Rab11 in apical membrane at later stages compromised
normal occupancy of crumb and DE-cadherin in Dmo mutants. The abundance of
these proteins were optimal and in agreement with this finding, no ectopic cell
intercalation was found. These observations suggest that sub optimal levels of
Rab11 at the apical membrane might be an indirect effect of reduced apical
delivery of luminal components. This shows that dysmorphic might function to
facilitate Rab11 mediated apical delivery of specific luminal matrix cargos.
Dmo interacts physically with MyoV, Rab11 and obst-A
Forgoing observations suggest that Dmo might regulate apical delivery of
recycling cargos of luminal proteins. I tested if there exist any physical interaction
between Dmo and other proteins involved in apical delivery, such as MyoV and 66
Rab11. MyoV is involved in the apical delivery of cargo proteins including gasp
and pio in Drosophila (B. X. Li and Ready 2007b; Massarwa and Shilo 2009).
Similarly Rab11 is a recycling endosome marker and shown to form a complex
with MyoV during apical delivery (B. X. Li and Ready 2007b). Additional
confirmation for the interaction between Rab11 and MyoV was described in
different systems (Hales and Goldenring 2002; Lapierre et al. 2001). Hence,
primarily I investigated whether Dmo interacts with MyoV and Rab11. For this,
co-immunoprecipitation analysis followed by protein specific western analysis
was performed in UAS-HA-Dmo embryos compared to wild type embryos. The
data obtained indicates a possible interaction between Dmo with MyoV and
Rab11. In this experiment β-actin was used as a loading control. Since Dmo
mutants exhibit a later stage localization defect of luminal proteins, I next
examined if Dmo interacts with any of the luminal components. The pull down
assay followed by western analysis demonstrates that, Dmo interacts with obst-A,
but did not show any interaction with other luminal components such as verm and
serp. Gasp is another luminal protein critically mislocalized by Dmo mutation.
However, reduced sensitivity of gasp antibody on western blot prevented us to
confirm potential interaction between gasp and Dmo. I also tested if Dmo forms
complex with one of the exocyst components sec8, but no interaction was
observed. These observations suggest that Dmo might form a complex with MyoV
and Rab11 and somehow participate in the apical delivery of obst-A mainly during
cargo recycling. Inorder to explore the possible involvement of MyoV in apical 67
delivery of obst-A, I analyzed obst-A localization in MyoV mutants. MyoV
mutants indeed showed a reduced localization of obst-A in the tracheal lumen
when compared to the wild type. This observation further confirm the possible
MyoV dependent role of Dmo in the apical delivery of obst-A. I also analyzed the
obst-A localization in Rab11DN embryos. However, Rab11DN expression in the
embryos greatly disrupted the overall tracheal integrity precluding further analysis
of obst-A localization. These observations also suggest that Dmo might directly
influence the localization of obst-A alone, and the impaired localization of other
luminal proteins such as verm and serp could be an aftereffect of obst-A reduction
in the trachea as observed previously in obst-A mutants (Petkau et al. 2012;
Tiklová and Samakovlis 2013b). Similarly, it was previously shown that obst-A is
required to prevent premature degradation of luminal components including chitin.
Hence reduced chitin localization in tracheal lumen of Dmo mutants at later stages
could be attributed to the decrease in obst-A abundance. 68

and physiological levels of Dmo (not over expressed) was used as a control.
Beta- actin was used as a loading control. Molecular weight of each protein is
represented in Kilo Daltons (KD). 69
Slight increase in the distribution of F-actin at the apical membrane of Dmo
mutants
Tube size defects and associated cell shape changes could potentially be
attributed to the cytoskeletal rearrangements at the cell surface. One of the distinct
characteristics of the epithelial tube is the presence of a dense layer of F-actin at
the apical side of the cells facing lumen. In Drosophila tracheal dorsal trunk, Factin
first appears in the apical side of the cells at stage 13 of embryogenesis.
Formin-Family Protein Diaphanous (Dia) and its upstream effector Rho1 was
shown to be responsible for actin nucleation and subsequent actin localization at
the apical membrane (Massarwa and Shilo 2009). Apical F-actin serves as a track
for the trafficking and polarized secretion of apically secreted luminal proteins.
Accordingly in the absence of F-actin at the apical membrane, there shown to be a
complete absence of luminal gasp and Pio. Hence, I examined the localization of
apical F-actin in both wild type and Dmo mutants. Apical F-actin distribution was
slightly increased in most of the Dmo mutant embryos compared to the wild type.
However, no changes in the localization of F-actin was observed. This observation
fits to the fact that there is no secretion defect in Dmo mutants at early stages of
embryogenesis. This finding further strengthen the hypothesis that the components
of general apical secretion machinery is unaffected in Dmo mutants. 70
Decreased localization of activated Moesin at the apical membrane
Moesin is a highly conserved protein which localizes predominantly to the
apical surface of epithelia. Moesin is the only ERM family protein found in
Drosophila. Upon phosphorylation Moesin cross links actin cytoskeleton with the
plasma membrane. Thus phosphorylation of Moesin impart rigidity to the apical
membrane (Kunda et al. 2008). In agreement with this theory suboptimal levels of
p-Moesin at the apical membrane of tracheal DT and salivary gland leads to
elongated tubes. (Cheshire et al. 2008). Since Dmo mutants show elongated
tracheal dorsal trunk, I analyzed the abundance of p-Moesin at the apical
membrane. Considerable reduction in the localization of p-Moesin at the apical
membrane was observed in Dmo mutants compared to the wild type. This
phenotype was more obvious towards later stages of embryogenesis, in such a way
that stage 15 stage embryos showed comparable p-Moesin levels to the wild type.
However, from late stage 15 onwards, there were a significant reduction in the pMoesin
levels in mutants. However, the amount of total Moesin at the apical
membrane of Dmo mutants was similar to that of wild type. These observations
suggest that Dmo plays an important role in activation, but not the stabilization of
Moesin, at the apical membrane of tracheal cells. In Drosophila S2 cells and
embryos β-Spectrin, another actin cross linking protein, and Moesin are recruited
to the apical membrane of the epithelial cells by crumbs (Médina et al. 2002).
There is no difference in the apical localization of crumbs or β-Spectrin between 71

Dmo mutant and wild type embryos. This further emphasize the finding that the
recruitment of Moesin to the apical membrane in unaltered in Dmo mutants.
Furthermore, previous studies reported that suboptimal or supra-optimal levels of
p-Moesin at the apical membrane of the photo receptor cells and imaginal discs
abolished actin cytoskeleton at the apical domain and disrupted epithelial integrity
(Karagiosis and Ready 2004; Speck et al. 2003). On the contrary, in Dmo mutant’s
actin distribution at the apical domain is not compromised, as seen under low
magnification. However, an ultra-structural examination of the apical membrane
under higher magnification needs to be performed for a detailed analysis of actin
before further confirmation.
Over activation of Rho1 in tracheal cells increases p-Moesin localization at
the apical membrane
 Former studies in mammalian cell lines demonstrated Rho-associated
protein kinase (ROCK) dependent phosphorylation of Moesin at threonine 559
residue by RhoA (Matsui et al. 1998; Shaw et al. 1998). However, in Drosophila
S2 cells, depletion of Rho1 caused only a modest reduction in the apical p-Moesin
(Hipfner, Keller, and Cohen 2004). Contradictory role of Rho1 in down regulating
apical p-Moesin during Drosophila salivary gland lumen formation has also been
described (Xu et al. 2011). Interestingly, a negative feedback loop exist between
activation of Moesin and Rho1 pathway in Drosophila imaginal disc (Speck et al.
2003). However, role of Rho1 in Moesin phosphorylation in the tracheal 73
epithelium is not characterized yet. In order to explore the possible effect of Rho1
on phosphorylation of Moesin during tracheal development, active Rho1 (RhoA
V14) was expressed constitutively in the tracheal cells using Btl-gal4 driver. Rho1
constitutive activation in the trachea resulted in increased apical p-Moesin
compared to the wild type. Interestingly, under Dmo mutant background, Rho1
V14 expression in the tracheal cells rescued the enhanced p-Moesin phenotype
and showed comparable or slightly reduced levels than the wild type embryos.
However, expression of Rho1 dominant negative (Rho1N17) construct in wild
type and Dmo mutant background showed similar phenotype for p-Moesin.
Nonetheless, in the latter scenario the p-Moesin levels were not consistently
similar in all the embryos. Some embryos showed p-Moesin levels similar to that
of wild type and the others exhibited reduced localization. A similar observation
was described in Drosophila S2 cells upon depletion of Rho1 (Hipfner, Keller, and
Cohen 2004). These observations suggest that Rho1 may not act as the primary
activator of p-Moesin in wild type trachea. However, over activation of Rho1 in
wild type trachea could enhance p-Moesin levels and the enhanced p-Moesin can
be brought to normal by reducing the Dmo protein. This explains a possible
genetic interaction between Rho1 and Dmo in regulating tracheal p-Moesin when
Rho1 expression is upregulated in trachea.

Enrichment of slik at the apical membrane does not change in Dmo mutants
Sterile-20 like kinase Slik, is the primary player in the activation of Moesin
in both DT and terminal cells of trachea (Ukken et al. 2014b). Slik activates
Moesin by phosphorylating its regulatory threonine residue. Since Dmo mutants
showed a reduced apical enrichment of p-Moesin, I asked whether Dmo normally
enhance p-Moesin through a slik dependent pathway. To address this, I analyzed
slik localization in Dmo mutants as opposed to the wild type trachea. No
considerable difference in the slik enrichment at the apical membrane was
observed between Dmo mutant and wild type embryos. This observation cannot be
explained by foreseeing Dmo as a downstream component of slik pathway,
because slik directly phosphorylate Moesin. However, in this regard it is possible
to describe that, Dmo is required for the activity of slik but not for its localization.
Nonetheless, reduction of apical localization of p-Moesin in slik mutants are much
severe compared to the Dmo mutants. These observations suggest that Dmo could
enhance slik activity directly or indirectly thus contribute to the activation of
Moesin or Dmo activates Moesin through a different pathway other than slik.
Localization of p-Moesin is drastically reduced in obst-A mutant
One other possibility for reduced p-Moesin in Dmo mutants could be
through an indirect mechanism due to impaired localization of luminal
components. However, such impact of luminal proteins on p-Moesin is not 76

reported yet. Since Dmo mutants exhibited a significant reduction in the
localization of obst-A when compared to other luminal components at later stages,
first I analyzed the p-Moesin localization in obst-A mutants. I found a severe
reduction in the apical membrane localization of p-Moesin in tracheal cells of
obst-A mutants compared to the wild type. However, this defect was more
pronounced in DT and TC cells compared to LT and GB. Surprisingly, similar
pattern was observed in Dmo mutants. However, the reduced p-Moesin levels
were more severe in obst-A mutants compared to the Dmo mutants. This could be
explained by taking into consideration that, obst-A mutants are protein null and in
Dmo mutants, obst-A is severely reduced but not completely absent. These
observations suggest that reduced p-Moesin in dmo mutants could be attributed to
the reduced localization of obst-A.
Test for genetic interaction between Dmo and RTK signaling components
Unlike Exp, Reb does not negatively regulate RTK (EGFR, FGFR)
signaling to control tube size. Previous studies indicate that over-activated RTK
signaling, epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) or fibroblast growth factor
receptor (FGFR), in Drosophila type III receptor tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs)
mutants contributes to tracheal cyst formation in unicellular and intracellular
tubes, but not in the multicellular DT (Jeon and Zinn. 2009). Genetic interaction
studies suggest that Exp negatively regulates RTK signaling to prevent cyst
formation in these tubes (Iordanou, et al. 2014). If Reb functions similarly to Exp 78
by inhibiting RTK signaling to control DT size, then overactive RTK signaling is
the underlying cause of the tube-size defects in reb mutants. To test this possibility
we expressed the dominant negative (DN) forms of the EGFR and FGFR
(breathless (Btl) in trachea) in reb mutant trachea respectively in order to down
regulate RTK signaling. No obvious changes in reb mutant phenotype (Fig. 4B) by
suppressing EGFR (Fig. 4C) or Btl (Fig. 4D) were observed, suggesting that RTK
signaling does not play a significant role in Reb mediated tube-size regulation.
This is most likely due to the presence of Exp in reb mutants.

Conclusion
Discussion 80
Here we have analyzed the role of Smad protein Reb in the maintenance of
apical luminal matrix in Drosophila trachea. Reb and Exp redundantly regulate
the apical deposition of chitin. In reb single mutant, no obvious defect in chitin
secretion is observed due to the presence of Exp. Therefore, the analysis of the reb
single mutant allows us to investigate additional functions of Reb besides its role
in the secretion of chitin. However, despite the normal secretion of luminal
components, these components are not maintained in the lumen of reb mutants.
The increased cytoplasmic and reduced luminal localization of ObstA suggests a
defect in the recycling of the internalized ObstA in reb mutants. Furthermore, we
found direct physical interactions between Reb and ObstA, and between Reb and
Rab11 by co-immunoprecipitation. These results strongly suggest that Reb is
involved in the maintenance of luminal matrix through endocytic recycling of
ObstA.
Despite the progress made on understanding the apical secretion of luminal
components, the recycling of distinct luminal components are not well understood.
Various endocytic recycling pathways are likely involved in the maintenance of
luminal matrix. Rab9 regulates the retrograde recycling of Serp but not other
luminal components. This result suggests distinct luminal components are recycled
by various recycling pathways. The defective recycling of ObstA in reb mutants
and interaction between Reb-Rab11 and Reb-ObstA strongly suggests that Rab11
plays a role in the recycling of ObstA. Reb could be involved in the assembly,
trafficking, tethering, or fusion of the ObstA containing recycling vesicle to the 81
apical membrane. Nevertheless, the mechanism of Reb in regulating these
processes needs to be further investigated. In addition to the reduction of ObstA in
the lumen, we also observed reduction of other luminal components. Unlike
ObstA, we did not observe increased cytoplasmic localization of luminal proteins
Gasp, Verm, and Serp in reb mutants. Therefore, the reduction of these
components is possibly due to premature degradation, as luminal components are
degraded in obstA mutants.
Reb is a Smad protein. Smad proteins are generally known as mediators of
transforming TGF-β signaling. However, Reb subfamily proteins such as Reb and
Exp are not mediators of the TGF-β signaling. Genetic interaction studies suggest
that at least in part, Exp regulates Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) signaling to
control tube size. Very recently, an independent study suggests that Exp/Reb
regulates the deposition of chitin into the lumen. This work suggests that Reb is
involved in the recycling of luminal component ObstA. In summary, these results
indicate that Smads of the Reb family regulate cellular processes and signaling
pathways other than TGF-β signaling. This is possibly due to interaction with nonSmad
proteins. The Reb subfamily contains an N-terminal MH2 domain rather
than a C-terminal domain in regular Smads. We speculate that the protein structure
might affect the protein-protein interaction. Identification of additional Reb
interacting proteins and protein domains involved in the interaction by
biochemical approach will further reveal the mechanisms of Reb subfamily 82
proteins. The results presented here will provide novel insights of Smad in tubesize
regulation and expand our general knowledge about Smad proteins.

Abstract
Epithelia coordinate the polarity of individual cells, in space and time, with
surrounding cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) to organize threedimensional
structures that shape tissues and organs. One of the most important
features of epithelial polarization is the asymmetric distribution of membrane
surfaces with the apical surface facing a lumen or outside of the organism, and a
basolateral surface facing other cells and ECM. This chapter discuss the processes
required for the acquisition of the asymmetric distribution of membrane surfaces
during morphogenesis, which include trafficking pathways, vesicle-sorting
machineries, formation of junctional and polarity complexes, and the
establishment of signaling networks. In addition, different mechanisms and
patterns are described for forming luminal spaces, and how alterations in cell
polarity are associated with important human diseases such as cancer.
This provides a lead towards the function (pathway) of the human gene and could
help in the development of effective drugs. The analysis of fly embryonic
development has made a particularly important contribution to the understanding
of developmental processes in humans. For example, the genetic basis of many
human birth defects is now known by the studies in developmental mutants in the
fly 83
